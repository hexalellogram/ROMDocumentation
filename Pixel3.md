# Pixel 3 (blueline)

I use the stock Google firmware for my Pixel, since it is still supported by Google and still receives the latest versions of Android promptly.

[Factory Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/images)

[Full OTA Images for Nexus and Pixel Devices](https://developers.google.com/android/ota)

Note that flashing the OTA images do not require unlocking the bootloader, while flashing factory images requires a bootloader unlock.
